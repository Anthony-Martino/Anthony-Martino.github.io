            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h3>Creative, passionate, adventure-enthusiast making the leap to a career in software development</h3>
            <p>Hi, I'm Anthony and I'm a former environmental geologist turned software developer. 
                I've always had an abundant enthusiasm for technology and the outdoors. This enthusiasm led me to a degree
                in Geology from Bowling Green State University. I spent the last two years working as a geologist 
                for a national consulting firm where I acquired experience in data analyzation, project management, 
                and technical document preparation.
            </p>
            <p> After two years, I found myself feeling stagnant and looking to expand my horizons. 
                I decided to take a deep dive into the programming world. After several months of self-learning through online resources, 
                I fell in love with programming. I enrolled at Tech Elevator to build a foundation of knowledge that is 
                necessary to be a competitive developer. Attending Tech Elevator has been one of the most rewarding endeavors i've embarked upon. 
                Thriving in this environment, I am excited to pursue a career in development. I am looking for a company who can both challenge me and 
                hold me accountable to produce high quality work, and help me push the boundaries of my capabilities.
